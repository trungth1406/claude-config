description: The quality doctrine — thresholds, SOLID signals, code taste, test discipline. Use when reviewing or refactoring code, judging a diff or PR, deciding if code is complete, enforcing coverage gates, or when code-review, pr-review, improve-codebase-architecture, or request-refactor-plan need their standards.

# Clean Code Doctrine

The single authority for code quality. Review skills (`code-review`, `pr-review`),
the refactor branch (`improve-codebase-architecture`, `request-refactor-plan`),
and the testing gate all judge against this file. Nothing elsewhere restates a
number from here.

## Thresholds

Enforced at review and refactor time, never inside the red → green loop.
Violations name the fix.

| Unit | Limit | On violation |
|---|---|---|
| Function length | ≤20 lines (ideal 5–15) | Extract method |
| Function params | ≤3 | Introduce parameter object |
| Cognitive complexity | ≤15 | Extract; invert conditions |
| Cyclomatic complexity | ≤10 | Replace conditional with polymorphism |
| Nesting depth | ≤4 | Guard clauses, early return |
| Class | ≤200 lines, ≤20 methods | Extract class |
| File | ≤500 lines (target 200–300) | Split module |
| Package | <20 classes | Split package |
| Line | 80–120 chars | Wrap |
| Duplication | ≤3% (>6 lines or >50 tokens) | Extract the missing abstraction |
| Coverage | ≥90% overall, ≥95% critical paths | Add tests before merge |
| Unit test | <100ms | Move it to the integration suite |

## Design principles — the signal matters, not the definition

- **SRP** — one reason to change. Signal: class over the method limit, or high LCOM.
- **OCP** — signal: if/else or switch chain on a type code → polymorphism.
- **LSP** — signal: `NotImplementedException` in a subclass, or a base-class test
  failing on a derived type.
- **ISP** — signal: interface >10 methods, or implementers stubbing members out.
- **DIP** — signal: `new` on a collaborator inside business logic → inject via constructor.
- **DRY** — one authoritative representation per fact.
- **KISS / YAGNI** — simplest thing that works, only what is required now. Dead code
  and unused params are violations.
- **Law of Demeter** — immediate friends only. Signal: `a.getB().getC()`, or a method
  using more of another object than its own.
- **Coupling** — prefer passing data over flags or structures. Never share global
  state or reach into another module's internals.

**Clean Architecture** — dependencies point inward only: Entities → Use Cases →
Interface Adapters → Frameworks & Drivers. No inner-to-outer imports; enforce with
architecture tests, invert with DI. Circular dependencies are never acceptable.

**Function shape** — do one thing. Prefer pure. Command/query separation: do
something *or* return something, not both.

**Error handling**
- Exceptions for exceptional cases; error codes / Result for expected conditions.
- Fail fast at system boundaries; validate all input there.
- Never swallow an exception. Messages state what failed and what to do about it.
- Release resources in `finally` / RAII / `defer`.
- No null returns — Optional / Maybe / Result, or Null Object.

**Self-documenting** — extract until you can't; name intermediates to explain them
(`isEligible = age > 65 && income < 50000`); function names carry intent
(`ensureUserHasPermission()`); domain language, used consistently. Method order:
public → private, abstract → concrete, high → low.

**Smells worth naming**: divergent change (one class, many reasons), shotgun surgery
(one change, many classes), refused bequest (subclass ignores its inheritance),
middle man (>50% pure delegation), data clumps (same 3+ variables travelling
together), feature envy.

## Test Discipline

Green is a checkpoint, never a stopping point. The ladder:
1. **Unit tests** — on the logic extracted once there are types to test against.
2. **Integration tests** — against real infrastructure (testcontainers, real
   binaries, real ports). A test that mocks the thing it verifies is decoration —
   delete it.
3. **E2E tests** — the whole path, driven the way a caller or user drives it.

Seams decide where tests live; coverage only tells you whether the seams reached
far enough. Coverage short of the floor means a behavior has no seam — add the
seam, never reach into internals to raise a number.

Assert everything the behavior touches: return value, mutated state, persisted
rows, emitted messages, and the error path. One behavior per test.

FIRST: fast, independent, repeatable, self-validating, timely. Arrange-act-assert.
Written before the implementation. Tests ship in the same commit — not the next
commit, not the follow-up PR.

## Domain Model — DDD vocabulary

`domain-modeling` drives the elaboration.

- **Entity** — identity and lifecycle matter.
- **Value Object** — no identity, immutable, compared by value.
- **Aggregate** — the transaction and consistency boundary. One root, one lock.
- **Domain Event** — something that happened; named in past tense.
- **Domain Service** — behavior belonging to no single noun.
- **Repository** — the illusion of an in-memory collection of aggregates.
- **Specification** — a business rule made an object.

Behavior lives on the nouns. An entity of getters and setters with a service
holding all the rules is the anemic model this exists to eliminate. Ubiquitous
language: the names in the code are the names the business uses.

## Code Taste — judgment calls

- **Comments are a confession.** Fix the code, not the comment. Exceptions:
  non-obvious external constraints, measured performance reasons, spec/RFC
  references, TODOs with ticket numbers.
- **Speculative abstractions are debt.** No fields, params, interfaces, or
  extension points for imagined futures. If removing it breaks no current caller,
  remove it.
- **Pre-existing dead code is not yours to delete.** Clean up only the orphans
  your own change created; mention the rest.
- **Duplication is a design bug.** The test: can you change behavior in one place
  and have everything that should change actually change?
- **Building things nobody asked for is the worst code.** Who asked? What breaks
  without it? "In the future" → flag it, don't build it.

**Before declaring code complete:** no unnecessary comments, every field has a
consumer, no duplication, tests in same commit, names self-documenting, nothing
built that wasn't asked for.
